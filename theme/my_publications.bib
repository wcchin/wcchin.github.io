  abstract={The COVID-19 pandemic has altered urban mobility patterns as various travel restrictions were imposed at different stages of the pandemic. Such dynamics inevitably affect the structure of urban spatial interactions underlying disease spreading. Understanding the spatial interaction structure and its dynamics is crucial for disease control. Through detecting networked communities, we identified latent movement boundaries emerged from actual human movement flows. We analyzed intra- and intercommunity flows that not only capture the regional and cross-region urban mobility structures but also facilitate the expansion and relocation diffusion processes. Networks representing four snapshots (prepandemic, lockdown, transition, and normal) were analyzed. The intracommunity flow intensities indicated similar patterns across four snapshots, suggesting the relative stability of the local expansion diffusion patterns throughout the study period. The intercommunity analysis showed the changes of spatial interaction intensities within the city, signifying the dynamic of the cross-regions disease spreading. Analyzing the intra- and intercommunity network structures provided a more holistic understanding of the dynamic urban mobility structures during the pandemic, highlighting the potential disease diffusion processes. This framework can also be used for disease management strategies simulation and future mobility-related urban planning. },

  abstract={Comprehending urban form and function is crucial for effective urban planning and redevelopment. However, delineating urban functional zones and understanding the diverse activities within a city poses challenges. To address this, our study proposes a comprehensive analysis framework utilising point-of-interest (POI) data to identify and characterise urban functional zones and associated amenities. Leveraging geocoded user-generated content enables an effective capture of the spatial structure of human activities. We applied our framework in case studies in two Singapore locations, demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying urban functional zone shapes and examining associated amenities. The findings reveal a spatial configuration of amenities across the urban area, highlighting a diversity often differing from planned land-uses. This underscores the complex and non-uniform nature of the urban living experience, as observed variations in mixed uses challenge the homogeneity of intended land-use types. Our study and analysis framework provide a foundation for further investigations, including exploring travel behaviour patterns and assessing the vibrancy and vitality of urban areas.},

This made the identification of waves with the time series of the cases a difficult task. Human activity intensities may affect the occurrence of an outbreak. We demonstrated a metric of time series, namely log-moving-average-ratio (LMAR), to identify the waves and directions of the changes in the disease cases and check-ins (MySejahtera). Based on the detected waves and changes, we explore the relationship between the two. Using the stimulus-organism-response model with our results, we presented a four-stage model: (1) government-imposed movement restrictions, (2) revenge travel, (3) self-imposed movement reduction, and (4) the new normal. The inverse patterns between check-ins and pandemic waves suggested that the self-imposed movement reduction would naturally happen and would be sufficient for a smaller epidemic wave. People may spontaneously be aware of the severity of epidemic situations and take appropriate disease prevention measures to reduce the risks of exposure and infection. In summary, LMAR is more sensitive to the waves and could be adopted to characterize the association between travel willingness and confirmed disease cases.},

  abstract = {Disease diffusion happens when infected and susceptible individuals move around and closely interact with each other. The boundary of human movement can be found by analysing the locations of amenities and people. The human movement boundaries can be considered as the zones of disease diffusion, which is essential for the establishment of disease control measures. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Malaysia had gone through a series of nationwide Movement Control Orders (MCO)—multiple phases of country/city lockdown measures—starting from March 2020. One key order during MCO was to restrict the travel distance to a 10 km radius from household locations. However, this movement restriction can only eliminate/reduce the long-range disease spreading (relocation) but not the disease diffusion within a local area (expansion). The disease can still be transmitted within a neighbourhood and between closely located or densely interacted neighbourhoods. In other words, people who visited the same region of an outbreak cluster would still expose to the disease. This study analyses the boundaries of densely connected neighbourhoods based on the amenity-sharing relationships, i.e., the disease diffusion zones, and identify the vulnerable locations in terms of spreading and contracting diseases, i.e., the centre(s) of zones. Using Peninsular Malaysia as a case study, a four-step framework was established, which utilised the open-data materials and open-source software. The analysis results from the case study showed that while some of the zones resembled the administrative boundaries, a considerable proportion of the zones extended the city area to the neighbouring urbanised area while some zones split a city into separated zones. These identified zones function as a reference for future policymaking on disease control issues.},

However, the effect of different water sound levels on psychological and physiological health remains unclear. This study used a VR natural environment—combining forest scene and waterfall sounds—to compare the low and high water sound levels' effects on individuals' psychological (affective quality of place and state anxiety relief) and physiological benefits (heart rate variability). We focused on two comparisons in each of the two dimensions: (1) a before-and-after comparison that analyzes the effectiveness of the water sounds, and (2) a low-and-high comparison that investigates the differences between the two sound levels. A total of 45 university students (aged between 19 and 23) participated in the experiment. The results show that both low- and high-decibel levels improved in psychological dimension, and decrease individuals’ heart rates from anxiety status. More importantly, while the high-decibel served to awaken emotions, the low-decibel was more effective at calming emotions and relieving anxiety. Overall, we found that natural waterscape sounds relieve transient anxiety states and promote healthy autonomic nervous activity. This study provides evidence for the planning of healthy environmental interaction patterns and the design of urban soundscapes.},

Assessing community vulnerability to infectious diseases thus requires not only information on local demographic and built environmental conditions, but also insights into human activity interactions with neighboring areas that can lead to the transition of vulnerability from locations to locations. This study presented an analytical framework based on the Particle Swarm Optimization model to estimate the weights of the factors for vulnerability modeling, and a local proportional parameter for use in the integration of the local and neighboring area risks. A country model and five cross-region validation models were developed for the case study of Singapore to assess the vulnerability to COVID-19. The results showed that the identified weights for the factors were robust throughout the optimization process and across various models. The local proportional parameter could be set slightly higher in between 0.6 and 0.8 (out of 1), signifying that the local effect was higher than the neighboring effect. Computation of the weights from the optimal solutions for the integrated vulnerability index showed that the factors of human activity intensity and accessibility to amenities had much higher weights, at 0.5 and 0.3, respectively. Conversely, the weights of population density, elderly population, social economic status and land use diversity were much lower. These findings underscored the importance of considering non-equal weights for factors and incorporating spatial interactions between local and neighboring areas for vulnerability modeling, to provide to a more comprehensive assessment of vulnerability to infectious diseases.},

Kampung Admiralty (KA), a unique development integrating housing for the elderly with various facilities, serves as a case study. The methodology combines static spatial network measures and real-world movement data to predict movement flows, accessibility, and connectivity. Lift lobbies and elevated garden connectors emerged as critical paths, effectively distributing pedestrian flows. Landscape spaces played a key role in visual and physical connectivity, offering high recreational and social value. Strategic placement of “social attractors” improved space utilization. The study highlights the importance of spatial design parameters in user-space interactions and provides insights into socio-spatial networks at both ground and elevated levels. It identifies key connectors that facilitate effective planning and design of vertically integrated public space networks, promoting social and spatial effectiveness.},

  abstract = {A high level of connectivity is one of the key objectives in the planning and design of many urban developments. However, during an epidemic event, a frequent practice to control the spread of the disease is to control the access, e.g., through measures of safe distancing (social distancing) or zone isolation (lockdown). These measures conflict with the objective to increase the connectivity of spaces, i.e., the increment of connectivity would also increase the possible movement of people between places and thus increase the risk of disease spreading. Therefore, the evaluation of the development layout and the resilience of its spatial network with the consideration of both connectivity and separation becomes an important task. To understand how the connectivity of spaces affects the spread of a disease, this paper proposes an analytic framework based on the spatial mapping of human movement at the urban and architectural scale. This approach allows for the evaluation of the effects of isolating spatial nodes on the disease spreading process in a spatial network. Our paper explores how the connectivity of nodes affects people flow and identifies the morphological and typological features of a spatial layout that relates to that connectivity. Next, it evaluates the dynamic effects of altering the network structure on movement and clustering of people through a series of link removal analyses. Our findings suggest that for the scale of our case study, a compact university campus in Singapore, complete zone-separation or isolation measures may not be necessary. Instead, breaking the high edge-betweenness links can increase the spatial separation while reduce physical interactions and close contacts by forcing people to take less frequented route detours. By framing the spaces of such a built environment as a complex adaptive system, the results provide important insights into human-centered design and interventions for public health at the building and urban scale.},

Our framework uses sensor data from a barometer, accelerometer, and Wi-Fi scanner coupled with an extraction step involving a combination of feature engineering and data segmentation. This methodology is subsequently integrated into a machine-learning-based classifier to automatically distinguish vertical displacement activity—with 98\% overall accuracy and a 92\% F1-score—from its horizontal counterpart. We illustrate the potential of this framework by applying it to an unstructured large-scale data set associated with over 16,000 participants going about their daily activity in the city-state of Singapore. With the vertical movements of this large group uncovered, we can analyze the specific features of this activity class using its statistical distribution. This new knowledge would have significant ramifications for the architectural design of vertical cities. },

  abstract={In a disease outbreak context, disease cases are usually presented by using point distribution data. Due to the scale-invariant issue of point data and the scaling issue of the modifiable areal unit problem, identifying a critical scale for the analysis of point patterns, such as the clustering phenomenon, is important. This study proposes a novel data-driven framework for calculating the critical scale based on two traditional concepts: (1) the point-region quadtree spatial indexing method and (2) the box counting method for fractal pattern analysis. Both concepts capture the spatial scaling process and serve as the core concepts of the proposed framework. Using dengue fever cases in Kaohsiung City, Taiwan, during the past two decades, the critical scale was identified for each outbreak year. Two clustering analysis approaches were used to test the resulting critical scales, including kernel density estimation and density-based spatial clustering application with noise. Both clustering analyses involved distance parameter settings. Therefore, through the setting of search radii, the two clustering methods were used as a tool to explore the clustering patterns under different scale levels. In summary, the identified critical scales can better capture the spatial patterns of point data.    疾病的空間群聚分析中常用點資料型態對病例分布位置進行標記與分析。因為點資料的無尺度特性與可調整面單元問題,計算出適當的分析尺度對進行點分布的群聚分析非常關鍵。本研究提出一個資料導向的新分析架構以計算出臨界尺度。此架構是基於兩項經典分析概念:一、點區塊四分樹空間索引方法,二、碎型型態分析中的計算格子法。這兩者都具有捕捉空間跨尺度過程的特性,而這跨尺度特性即為此分析架構的核心概念。本研究應用臺灣高雄市過去近20年的登革熱病例資料作為分析對象,應用前述分析架構計算出每一波疫情年的臨界尺度。透過兩種群聚分析方法,包括核密度推估法與基於密度群聚與噪點分析法,本研究對臨界尺度所計算出來的群聚結構與其他尺度計算所得之群聚結構進行比較與討論。這兩項群聚分析都需設定一距離參數,即其搜尋半徑。因此,本研究透過設定不同的搜尋半徑,借用兩項群聚分析方法所得的群聚型態作為比較不同尺度下的點分布型態以進行比較討論。兩項群聚分析的比較結果都顯示在臨界尺度所計算的群聚結構特性相對較可突出其分布型態。},

While this disease is seemingly not as deadly compared to SARS, Ebola, or MERS, it is an exceptionally virulent plague. Evidence has suggested that certain segments of the population and environmental attributes are more vulnerable. Specifically, the elderly people and those with pre-existing medical conditions reported the highest morbidity from COVID-19 infection. Places that are densely populated, with voluminous human traffic, and fleeting social interactions are ostensibly most conducive for viral transmission. Geospatial networks with high centrality and transitivity such as public transportations, leisure and recreational spaces, and workplaces, are locations most susceptible to COVID-19. In response to this epidemic, Singapore entered into a lockdown to curb the spread. All but essential workers such as those in healthcare, public services, and critical supply chains, were required to work from home and minimize interpersonal contact. This study aims to understand local vulnerability by introducing changes of risks and human mobilities across space and time. The study develops a socio-ecological framework of epidemiology using a set of social, built, and spatial features known to influence disease transmission. Subzones with higher integrated vulnerabilities could receive greater epidemiological attention and support in future pandemics. },

Previous studies focused on the distribution of the activity or the partition of regions based on similarity or strength of the interaction, but not the collective activity spaces and times of the people who live within the area. Using only the geotagged/timestamped social media as a proxy, this study intended to delineate activity spaces and times of eight selected cities, including Tokyo, Osaka, Hongkong, Singapore, Bangkok, Jakarta, Manila, and Penang. Activity space is defined as a geographic extent where people undertake their daily life. This study generated two co-occurrence networks (spatial and temporal) for each city and delineated the activity spaces and times using a network community detection method. In summary, the results showed a clear pattern for both activity spaces and times in the eight cities. The activity spaces results showed spatially continuous communities with clear borders, indicated the boundaries of human movements, which may be affected by political or natural separation. The activity time results existed a cyclic pattern on a daily and weekly basis, indicating the habits of people in each city, and which pattern is slightly different between cities. In conclusion, this study demonstrated a framework for delineating activity spaces and provided a novel perspective for representing the space and time patterns of daily life in a city. },

  abstract={Huang et al. used their EpiRank algorithm, which emphasizes forward-and-backward commuter flow between homes and workplaces, to analyze the distribution patterns of two infectious diseases in Taiwan： the 2009-H1N1 influenza virus and the widespread emergence of the 2000-2008 type 71 enterovirus (EV). As this article was being prepared, the spreading mechanism of the novel coronavirus disease now designated as COVID-19 had yet to be identified, but according to the American Centers for Disease Control, its spreading mechanism and patterns are likely more similar to influenza than to other coronaviruses such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV-1) or Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV). To consider potential COVID-19 spatial patterns, we applied EpiRank to the 2003 SARS outbreak in north Taiwan for comparison with H1N1 and EV. SARS was found to be less contagious than H1N1 or EV, but with a significantly higher fatality rate. The characteristics of these diseases determined their specific spatial spreading patterns, as reflected in the different effects of forward and backward commuting movement. Our motivation is to highlight these differences and to illustrate EpiRank spatial patterns for the 2003 SARS outbreak for comparison with EpiRank-determined distributions for the H1N1 and EV outbreaks. Our results indicate that the daytime parameter (i.e., forward movement effect) range was slightly higher (0.5-0.55) for the SARS outbreak than for either the influenza (0.4-0.5) or EV (0.3-0.5) outbreaks, suggesting that the forward-and-backward movements of individuals between residential and core urban areas with concentrated populations were equally important regarding the spread of SARS. While COVID-19 might resemble either SARS or H1N1 in terms of spatial spreading, its daytime parameter is likely somewhere in-between, with backward movement being dominant (similar to H1N1) or with forward and backward movement being equally important (similar to SARS). Building on Huang et al.’s paper, we present an estimated risk distribution pattern for the Taipei Metropolitan Area for a daytime parameter of 0.55. },

  abstract={Barometers are among the oldest engineered sensors. Historically, they have been primarily used either as environmental sensors to measure the atmospheric pressure for weather forecasts or as altimeters for aircrafts. With the advent of microelectromechanical system (MEMS)-based barometers and their systematic embedding in smartphones and wearable devices, a vast breadth of new applications for the use of barometers has emerged. For instance, it is now possible to use barometers in conjunction with other sensors to track and identify a wide range of human activity classes. However, the effectiveness of barometers in the growing field of human activity recognition critically hinges on our understanding of the numerous factors affecting the atmospheric pressure, as well as on the properties of the sensor itself—sensitivity, accuracy, variability, etc. This review article thoroughly details all these factors and presents a comprehensive report of the numerous studies dealing with one or more of these factors in the particular framework of human activity tracking and recognition. In addition, we specifically collected some experimental data to illustrate the effects of these factors, which we observed to be in good agreement with the findings in the literature. We conclude this review with some suggestions on some possible future uses of barometric sensors for the specific purpose of tracking human activities. },

  abstract={As lockdowns and stay-at-home orders start to be lifted across the globe, governments are struggling to establish effective and practical guidelines to reopen their economies. In dense urban environments with people returning to work and public transportation resuming full capacity, enforcing strict social distancing measures will be extremely challenging, if not practically impossible. Governments are thus paying close attention to particular locations that may become the next cluster of disease spreading. Indeed, certain places, like some people, can be “super-spreaders”. Is a bustling train station in a central business district more or less susceptible and vulnerable as compared to teeming bus interchanges in the suburbs? Here, we propose a quantitative and systematic framework to identify spatial super-spreaders and the novel concept of super-susceptibles, i.e. respectively, places most likely to contribute to disease spread or to people contracting it. Our proposed data-analytic framework is based on the daily-aggregated ridership data of public transport in Singapore. By constructing the directed and weighted human movement networks and integrating human flow intensity with two neighborhood diversity metrics, we are able to pinpoint super-spreader and super-susceptible locations. Our results reveal that most super-spreaders are also super-susceptibles and that counterintuitively, busy peripheral bus interchanges are riskier places than crowded central train stations. Our analysis is based on data from Singapore, but can be readily adapted and extended for any other major urban center. It therefore serves as a useful framework for devising targeted and cost-effective preventive measures for urban planning and epidemiological preparedness. },

  abstract={Many real-world networks consisting of nodes representing (in)tangible asymmetric information or energy flows must be modeled as directed graphs (digraphs). Several methods for classifying non-directional edges in terms of strong or weak ties have been developed for well-known non-directional networks, but none specifically for directed networks. In almost all cases, definitions and identification methods are simple, incomplete, reliant on intuition, and based on the assumption that anything that is not weak must be strong. Researchers have generally failed to consider overlapping and hierarchical community properties that accurately reflect organizational structures or the functional components commonly found in real-world complex networks, resulting in multiple challenges to analyzing many types of directed networks. In this paper we describe a method that considers asymmetric definitions of arc strength, especially when arcs hold important directional significance. To more fully capture overlapping and hierarchical network community structures, we used hierarchy-based definitions to identify bond arcs, k th-layer local bridges, global bridges, and silk arcs and to create a hierarchical arc type analysis (HATA) algorithm. The algorithm employs a mix of common middle node measures and statistical parameters generated by randomized directed networks corresponding to the network being investigated. To test the HATA algorithm, we conducted four experiments involving a mix of arc rewiring and additions, multiple datasets associated with the Travian game, 56 empirical networks from previous studies, and 3 bird song transition networks. Our results indicate that HATA offers a novel perspective to understanding arc strengths and structures in directed complex networks. },

Here we describe our proposal for a hierarchical edge type analysis (HETA) algorithm for determining link types at multiple network hierarchy levels based on the common neighbor concept plus statistical factors such as bond links, kth-layer local bridges, global bridges, and silk links—all generated during long-term network development and evolution processes. Two sets of networks were used to validate our proposed algorithm, one consisting of 16 networks employed in multiple past studies, and one consisting of two types of one-dimensional small-world networks expressing different random rewiring or shortcut addition probabilities.

The authors use a Markov chain model and PageRank-like algorithm to construct a novel algorithm called EpiRank to measure infection risk in a spatially confined commuting network on Taiwan island. Data from the country’s 2000 census were used to map epidemic risk distribution as a commuting network function. A daytime parameter was used to integrate forward and backward movement in order to analyze daily commuting patterns. EpiRank algorithm results were tested by comparing calculations with actual disease distributions for the 2009 H1N1 influenza outbreak and enterovirus cases between 2000 and 2008. Results suggest that the bidirectional movement model outperformed models that considered forward or backward direction only in terms of capturing spatial epidemic risk distribution. EpiRank also outperformed models based on network indexes such as PageRank and HITS. According to a sensitivity analysis of the daytime parameter, the backward movement effect is more important than the forward movement effect for understanding a commuting network’s disease diffusion structure. Our evidence supports the use of EpiRank as an alternative network measure for analyzing disease diffusion in a commuting network. },

  abstract={Conventional spatial statistics analysis reveal either the global or local spatial pattern for point distribution but ignore the big picture of the point data, which can be observed through a scaling process. As discussed in spatial statistical studies, point distribution may show a scale-dependent spatial pattern, which situation is known as the modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP). On the other hand, as suggested in fractal analysis studies, the point pattern change at a consistent rate at the beginning of the scaling process, and the rate decrease after a scale. This scale of rate shifting (namely critical scale, CS) is the finest scale that can capture the big picture of the point distribution (namely macro pattern), i.e. the changes of pattern due to MAUP have the same effect since the global level, and the higher scales after CS will only affect the pattern of partial area. In this study, a scaling analysis framework was proposed to identify the critical scale, and a set of aggregation procedure was designed to convert the original point dataset into the macro pattern. Three experiments were conducted to test the scaling analysis framework, including two experiments on theoretical distributions and one on empirical point distributions. The three experiments were designed: (1) to test the aggregation effect on scaling process; (2) to test the influences of mono-centric clustering properties to the scaling analysis; and (3) to illustrates the contrast between macro patterns and the original distribution of empirical data. The results suggested that the aggregation point on critical scale could capture most of the spatial properties from original data; the area and number of point formed algorithm relationship with the critical and final scale; and the big picture of the point distribution could be captured by the macro pattern of the aggregated points on critical scale. Aside from the conventional understanding of point pattern as discussed in the previous global or local spatial statistics methods, this study provides not only a new tool but also a novel perspective of viewing the point distribution. This analysis framework, including the critical scale identification and macro pattern aggregation, can be useful for spatial point data exploration and map visualization.},

Therefore, the objective of this study is to propose a flow-based ranking algorithm for investigating traffic demands in terms of the attractiveness of street segments and flow complexity of the street network based on turning probability. Our results show that, by analyzing the topological characteristics of streets and volume data for a small fraction of street segments in Taipei City, the most congested segments of the city were identified successfully. The identified congested segments are significantly close to the potential congestion zones, including the officially announced most congested streets, the segments with slow moving speeds at rush hours, and the areas near significant landmarks. The identified congested segments also captured congestion-prone areas concentrated in the business districts and industrial areas of the city. Identifying the topological characteristics and flow complexity of traffic congestion provides network topological insights for sustainable urban planning, and these characteristics can be used to further understand congestion propagation. },

However, previous clustering analysis methods have focused only on space-time proximity characteristics, neglecting the temporal lag of the movement of events. We argue that the temporal lag between events is a key to understand the process of diffusion movement. Using the temporal lag could help to clarify the types of close relationships. This study aims to develop a data exploration algorithm, namely the TrAcking Progression In Time And Space (TaPiTaS) algorithm, for understanding diffusion processes. Based on the spatial distance and temporal interval between cases, TaPiTaS detects sub-clusters, a group of events that have high probability of having common sources, identifies progression links, the relationships between sub-clusters, and tracks progression chains, the connected components of sub-clusters. Dengue Fever cases data was used as an illustrative case study. The location and temporal range of sub-clusters are presented, along with the progression links. TaPiTaS algorithm contributes a more detailed and in-depth understanding of the development of progression chains, namely the geographic diffusion process. },

By overlapping these factors, street segments prone to traffic congestion are identified. A network modularity algorithm is used for delineating the traffic impact areas that will be affected by traffic congestion. Our results indicate that only relying on the topological structure of the street network, this framework could identify the Central Business Districts (CBD), and the areas proximate to the stations of the combination of MRT and train railway systems are prone to traffic congestion.

International travelers who acquire dengue infection are important routes for virus transmission from one country to another. Previous studies have shown that imported dengue cases are able to initiate indigenous epidemics when appropriate weather conditions are present. However, the spatial-temporal associations between imported dengue cases and indigenous epidemics in areas with different social-demographic conditions remain unclear. This study investigated the determinants of spatial-temporal lags of imported dengue cases that initiated indigenous epidemics from 2003 to 2012 in Taiwan. We constructed Origin-Destination (OD) pairs of transmission from imported townships to local emergence to capture two important epidemiological characteristics： 1) the risk of diffusion and 2) the speed of transmission. We further explored the spatial-temporal associations between disease importation and social-demographic indicators with geographic heterogeneity. Our results indicated that there were significant relationships between the time lags from imported cases to local emergence in late spring and early summer. Moreover, urbanization levels influence the speed of transmission. Our findings also showed that the risk of diffusion weighted by distance-decay characteristics increases the explanatory power of socioeconomic variables in imported townships. These findings imply that disease importation in late spring and early summer may be an early warning indicator of indigenous dengue epidemics and that the risk of transmission may be significantly influenced by the effects of inter-township travel. },

Therefore, the aims of this study were to establish actual patient flow for seeking healthcare and to clarify the factors influencing preferences for seeking healthcare. Methods: We estimated the residence and collected the locations of healthcare visits for each patient from the nationwide Longitudinal Health Insurance Database in 2010 to establish an origin-destination matrix. The patient flow among townships could be conducted from the matrix. The weighted travel distance of healthcare visits was developed as a new indicator of accessibility. The gravity model was then used to analyze the patient flow and assess the influences of travel distance and healthcare resources. Results: Using the weighted travel distance, eastern Taiwan and the coastal areas of Yunlin and Chiayi were identified as the poorest accessibility for healthcare resources. The results of the gravity model showed that travel distance was the major factor correlated negatively with the volumes of outpatient and inpatient/emergency flow; however, the abundance of healthcare resources positively influenced the preference of inpatient/emergency patients from their residence to neighborhood regions for seeking healthcare. Conclusions: The weighted travel distance could properly reflect the access of healthcare. We conclude that travel distance is the major factor which influences patient flow for seeking healthcare. In contrast, people tend to choose the healthcare facilities with abundant resources for seeking inpatient/emergency healthcare. 目標：過去研究多以行政區或醫療分區的每萬人口醫療資源數作為評估就醫可近性之指標,但分區的概念簡化民眾就醫行為,與實際醫療利用情形有所落差。本研究將以實際就醫流動資料呈現各地區醫療可近性,並量化就醫距離與醫療資源分布對就醫流動的影響。方法：使用全民健康保險研究資料庫2010年承保抽樣歸人檔,依居住地與就醫地建立流動起迄矩陣,計算各鄉鎮市區加權就醫距離作為可近性指標,再以引力模式估計影響就醫流動的因素。結果：加權就醫距離呈現出花東與雲嘉沿海等地有較差的醫療可近性。引力模式分析顯示,就醫距離與醫療資源皆顯著影響民眾的就醫流動。然而,相較於急診與住院的就醫流動,就醫距離對於門診就醫流動影響更為明顯。但於鄰近地區的就醫權衡,醫療機構一般病床數對於急診與住院就醫流動的吸引力,更重於就醫距離的效果。結論：加權就醫距離更能客觀反映一地醫療可近性。求近是台灣民眾就醫的首要考量,但民眾急診與住院就醫,則傾向在鄰近地區中尋求硬體規模最大者。 },

Class suspension is the most direct strategy to prevent the spread of disease through elementary or secondary schools by blocking the contact network.

The purpose of this study is to propose a methodological framework for generating campus location networks from a routine administration database, analyzing the community structure of the network, and identifying the critical links and nodes for blocking respiratory disease transmission. The data comes from the student enrollment records of a major comprehensive university in Taiwan. We combined the social network analysis and spatial interaction model to establish a geo-referenced community structure among the classroom buildings. We also identified the critical links among the communities that were acting as contact bridges and explored the changes in the location network after the sequential removal of the high-risk buildings. Instead of conducting a questionnaire survey, the study established a standard procedure for constructing a location network on a large-scale campus from a routine curriculum database. We also present how a location network structure at a campus could function to target the high-risk buildings as the bridges connecting communities for blocking disease transmission. },

A variety of attempts were made to continue this effort, but only with various degrees of success. Recognizing the critical role that distances between geographic objects or events play in a spatial diffusion process, we experimented with a new approach that uses these distances to detect and distinguish different types of spatial diffusion processes. Our approach is a two-step process that first calculates nearest neighbor ratios in a point process at each time step and then applies regression curve estimation to observe how these ratios change over time. We first report the results from applying this method to three spatio-temporal data sets which show the feasibility of our approach. We then report results of randomly simulated spatial diffusion processes to see if our approach is effective for the purpose of distinguishing different types of spatial diffusion processes. With only extreme cases as exceptions, our experiment found that using estimated regression curves of nearest neighbor ratios over time is usable in classifying spatial diffusion processes to either contagious/expansion or hierarchical/relocation diffusion processes.},

  abstract={A geospatial network represents the spatial relationships with the network perspective.  Within the scope of social network analysis, the network topology characteristics, including network centrality, small world and scale-free properties, have been well studied, and these concepts can also provide important implications on measuring the important of places in the geospatial network. PageRank (PR), which is an important link analysis algorithm, is what Google uses to determine how important a page is on the web. However, most measures of network analysis were designed to understand network topological structures rather than geographical structures. Therefore, these measures have not considered the geographical relationships as their main concern, including geographical distance decay effect between nodes. This study incorporates geographic properties, including distance-decay and spatial interactions among nodes, and proposes two modified PR algorithms, Inverse-Distance PageRank (IDPR) and Geographical PageRank (GPR). To test the performance of the index of importance (including IDPR and GPR), this study did two experiments with the inter-city network of Taiwan. In the first experiment, this study calculated the index of importance, and this study used the population data and inter-townships car flow data as observed data to check the Spearman Rank Correlation, and compared the correlation results with existing algorithms: PR and Weighted PageRank (WPR); in the second experiment, this study explore the changes of node’s importance between before and after the construction of Taiwan High Speed Rail System. Our findings in the first experiment showed that IDPR and GPR are better correlated to the observed data, and our findings in the second experiment showed that the GPR and WPR could capture the transitive effect. Since IDPR and GPR take the distance decay effect into account, results using the algorithms can capture more geographical properties. In conclusion, IDPR and GPR are better metrics to be used in geospatial network analysis; but, if the transitive effect is an important feature in the analysis, GPR is a better metric.},
