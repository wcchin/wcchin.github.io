title: A socio-ecological perspective on COVID-19 spatiotemporal integrated vulnerability in Singapore
excerpt: The COVID-19 epidemic has unleashed a trail of health and economic destruction since the first infected patient was reported in Wuhan, China in late 2019. While this disease is seemingly not as deadly compared to SARS, Ebola, or MERS, it is an exceptionally virulent plague. Evidence has suggested that certain segments of the population and environmental attributes are more vulnerable. Specifically, the elderly people and those with pre-existing medical conditions reported the highest morbidity from COVID-19 infection.

abstract: The COVID-19 epidemic has unleashed a trail of health and economic destruction since the first infected patient was reported in Wuhan, China in late 2019. While this disease is seemingly not as deadly compared to SARS, Ebola, or MERS, it is an exceptionally virulent plague. Evidence has suggested that certain segments of the population and environmental attributes are more vulnerable. Specifically, the elderly people and those with pre-existing medical conditions reported the highest morbidity from COVID-19 infection. Places that are densely populated, with voluminous human traffic, and fleeting social interactions are ostensibly most conducive for viral transmission. Geospatial networks with high centrality and transitivity such as public transportations, leisure and recreational spaces, and workplaces, are locations most susceptible to COVID-19. In response to this epidemic, Singapore entered into a lockdown to curb the spread. All but essential workers such as those in healthcare, public services, and critical supply chains, were required to work from home and minimize interpersonal contact. This study aims to understand local vulnerability by introducing changes of risks and human mobilities across space and time. The study develops a socio-ecological framework of epidemiology using a set of social, built, and spatial features known to influence disease transmission. Subzones with higher integrated vulnerabilities could receive greater epidemiological attention and support in future pandemics.
