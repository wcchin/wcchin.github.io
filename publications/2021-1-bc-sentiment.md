abstract: During the global pandemic of COVID-19, all affected countries have taken a series of contingent measures to thwart the spreading of the virus. Singapore is one of the countries affected by the first wave of the COVID-19 outbreak in January 2020. It entered the “Circuit Breaker” (CB) period on 7 April 2020 when most workplaces were closed and all schools moved to full day home-based learning. While the pandemic has evidently changed the daily routine of the residents, the emotional impact on them is less known. This study aimed to explore the emotional impacts of COVID-19 to the Singapore society during the pandemic. By analyzing social media (Twitter) data through sentiment analysis, this study revealed and discussed the residents' emotion patterns and their changes due to COVID-19 along the dimensions of anger, fear, anticipation, trust, surprise, sadness, joy, and disgust. The study found that people in Singapore generally had a high level of trust and positive attitude facing the crisis, but the emotional responses vary among people twitted with different languages.
