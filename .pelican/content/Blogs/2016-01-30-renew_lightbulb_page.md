### page closed~~~

The note page was changed to tiddler wiki based.

I am using tiddlywiki-desktop now, to write the tiddlers(posts) and journals(logs) with it, directly in the mynt staticsite folders.

The tiddlywiki is now locate in the asset folders, which can be linked to the note page via iframe.

Plus, the tiddlers can be open in a new tab, to show the tiddler and open the tiddlywiki as an independent (static but flowing/interactive) pages.

Tiddlywiki, a single-page-application, is a wiki style note-taking system. It is designed to be used as a one-file app, that open in the browser(html+js).
Tiddlers are linked to the related tiddlers, just the same as the "wiki" system. (It is a wiki system)

I am planning on migrating my tiddlyspace tiddlers into this tiddly, since they seem to be closed in the end of 2016.
