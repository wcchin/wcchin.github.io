Announcement: Gephi tutorial site in chinese is built
---

So, the site is built for a lab event in a workshop in 9/22. The reason I built this is because I think these basic guide might be needed in the begining of using this tool.

The website is served using the lab server:
<a href="http://wenlab.geog.ntu.edu.tw/gephi_tutorial/" target="_blank"> Gephi tutorial site </a>

In addition, a webpage is built with the gephi plugin -- Sigmajs Exporter -- <a href="http://wenlab.geog.ntu.edu.tw/gephi_sigma/network/#"> global migration network </a>. 

The website is built with a static-site generator, called <a href="http://www.mkdocs.org/" target="_blank">Mkdocs</a>, and they have the readthedocs template built-in.
