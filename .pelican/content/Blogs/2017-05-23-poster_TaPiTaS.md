Abstract:
Dengue Fever (DF) data is recorded as a space-time point data, i.e. each record contains a spatial location, and a temporal location. Previous studies often use clustering analysis method to analyze this type of disease case data, to search for spatial or space-time cluster areas (hot-spots), and connect the clusters manually. The process between disease clusters has been neglected in previous studies. 
In disease diffusion processes, transmissions may experience a temporal lag for an incubation period, that is the time between infection and disease emergence. Thus a temporal lag between the transmission pairs should be considered in the understanding of disease diffusion. This can help to systematically model the disease diffusion process, and construct the relationships between cases and detect the process chains between clusters. 
Therefore, the aim of this case study is to detect sub-clusters from the annual DF cases and identify processes between the sub-clusters.
