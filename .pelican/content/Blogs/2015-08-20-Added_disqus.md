In order to get feedbacks from friends, I added the Disqus commenting system in this site.

Adding a Disqus comment system in a static website is not difficult:

1. Sign-up on <a href="https://disqus.com" target="_blank">Disqus</a>.
2. Go to Settings, Admin.
3. Add new site and setup.
4. Go to Install, Universal Code, and copy the codes to the template/layout html file.
5. Regenerate the website, and push to the hosting server.

Thats all.
