Hooray~ This is an exciting news. 

My first article (me as the first author) has been published yesterday. It is rewritten from my master thesis. 
The idea came to my mind in the begining of the year 2012. Most of the development of the algorithms were done within the semester. 
Then I tried to test the algorithm in more ways, and finally all tryings were not end well. 
In april 2013, the algorithms were first proposed in an international conference in L.A.. Then I graduated in the following June/July. 
After that, the formal research on these algorithms were stop, and some other things keep comming up. 
Some further experiments were done. The codes were rewritten in matlab, then in python. I also made a GUI for the algorithms in Python. 
Although most of the testings did not give good results that worth noting, but, the understanding on the algorithms has became more clear. 

The article was submitted to the PLoSONE in the may 2015. After several times of revising, it was accepted in september after I came back from the FOSS4G conference at Seoul.  

The article is about developing two algorithms for analyzing geospatial network, to see where people or moving agents would be gathering in the connected geographical space. 
The algorithms were modified from the PageRank algorithm, in the similar way as the Weighted PageRank did. Two key elements were added, the geographical distance between nodes, and the attractiveness of each node. 

Two "experiments" were conducted. One of them is a national-scale, inter-cities network. And the other is a series of city-scale, within-city networks.
