It has been a long time since my last post. 

First thing is about this personal blog. It have been migrated from mynt to pelican, a well-known, well-developed, and well-maintained static-site-generator in python. 
One good thing from a well-XX generator is that they have a lot of fully functional and professional looking templates. The one I have been using with mynt, is a very simple, lightweight, skeleton css. And, it is a skeleton! I don't have time to develop a template for it.

So, I changed to pelican, and use one of the theme in the pelican-themes repos, which is this.

Another things are the works I have been working on. 

1. the visualization of the Taipei-MRT hourly origin-destination flows.
