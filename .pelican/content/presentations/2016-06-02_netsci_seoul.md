#### Abstract
With the growing number of large cities, traffic congestion became a global issue. Identifying where it could occur is the first question to resolve congestion. However, predicting the geographic extent of the congestion has seldom been discussed. Traffic impact areas (TIA) refer to areas that will be affected by traffic events. This study will explore more spatial factors that influence the TIA, including traffic flow and link topology of road network. We propose a novel flow-based analytical framework of ranking scheme to quantify interplay between urban road segments and identify the TIA. PageRank (PR) is the ranking algorithm used by Google Search Engine that calculates the scores of importance to rank and identify the significant webpages. PR assumes that people move randomly between webpages. Thus, the weights of all links are equal. However, human movement is not a random event. It is influenced by both network structure and an individual options. This study proposes a revised PR, Flow-based PageRank (FBPR), as the ranking scheme for road network. The weights of link structure in the proposed algorithm emphasize the attraction of road segmentsâ€™ local properties, and determine the distribution of traffic volume between road segments. Actual traffic volume data is used with a genetic algorithm to fit the FBPR model (figure 1a) for calibrating the attractiveness. The TIA is affected by the extent of interplay, where stronger interplay triggers a larger impact. The interplay is defined as the strength of traffic flow between roads. We establish a community indices to map the interplay. Then, the TIA can be identified (figure 1b). In summary, the FBPR can be used to construct link structure among roads, and the communities identified in the road network represent TIA. It could provide more insights of traffic management for city planners.
