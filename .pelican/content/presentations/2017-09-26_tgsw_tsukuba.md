#### Abstract
With the increasing uses of social media in everyday life, the living footprint of people is embedded in the social media records. The geotagged posts in social media recorded the where and when the users were. Therefore, the analysis of a large number of social media data can help to understand the human activity patterns, and which is useful for revealing the regional functions of the urban. Using Manhattan and Tokyo as the case study area, this study intended to use the twitter data to discover the human activity patterns within the cities, and analyze the connections between the locations. The strong connectivity is defined as if the two locations are visited by a large number of same people. Then, this study used community detection to search for the highly connected locations, which represent the areas with high intensity of human movements, i.e. the home-ranges or living-zones. The temporal dynamic of the aggregated users’ activities is used to analyze the regional functions of the areas. In summary, this study intended to reveal the urban’s patterns of living by using the social media data.
