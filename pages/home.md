# About Me
<div class="box">
<p align="justify">First, I'm a geographer. I'm a <u>Malaysian</u>. I was born in <u>Penang</u>. When I was 9, I moved to <u>Selangor</u> with my family. I continued my study at <u>Taipei</u> after graduated from Pin Hwa High School, Klang. I finished my undergraduate and master degree in <u>NTU, Taiwan</u>. I continued studying as a PhD. student at the same institute after I worked as a research assistance for a year. Then, I went back to my family at <u>Johor Bahru, Malaysia</u> before I joined <u>SUTD, Singapore</u> as a research fellow in 2019. Starting from 2022, I work as a research fellow at <u>NUS, Singapore</u>. 
Maybe moving around, meeting new people, and blending into different cultures, made me a geographer who's nature is to explore the world and places.  
</p>

<p align="justify">Second, I'm a cartographer. I made maps most of the time ever since I was a graduate student. I made maps for text book, for research articles, and also two wall size maps for the Geography Department, NTU. In addition to those are static-printed map, I also make interactive-web maps. I joined a research project which used web-map as the main tool for the early-warning system.  
</p>

<p align="justify">Third, I'm a GIScientist. GIS is not just a mapping tool. It is a system for gathering and presenting geographical information, and a platform for exploring the geographical-spaces. There are already so many analyzing methods for solving many types of problems. But, I believe this is just the beginning of the rising of GIS. In the age of BIG DATA, with the help of more and more computing power, there are still uncountable information await for digging from the geographical data. 
</p>

<p align="justify">
In simple words, I'm a guy who like thinking about connected spaces, working with computer, playing with data, drawing map, and writing some codes.
