  abstract={To date, the methodology to track and identify vertical movement from large-scale unstructured data sets is lacking. Here, we design and develop such a framework to accurately and systematically identify the sparse human vertical displacement activity typically buried into the predominantly horizontal mobility. Our framework uses sensor data from a barometer, accelerometer, and Wi-Fi scanner coupled with an extraction step involving a combination of feature engineering and data segmentation. This methodology is subsequently integrated into a machine-learning-based classifier to automatically distinguish vertical displacement activity—with 98\% overall accuracy and a 92\% F1-score—from its horizontal counterpart. We illustrate the potential of this framework by applying it to an unstructured large-scale data set associated with over 16,000 participants going about their daily activity in the city-state of Singapore. With the vertical movements of this large group uncovered, we can analyze the specific features of this activity class using its statistical distribution. This new knowledge would have significant ramifications for the architectural design of vertical cities. },

Singapore is one of the countries affected by the first wave of the COVID-19 outbreak in January 2020. It entered the “Circuit Breaker” (CB) period on 7 April 2020 when most workplaces were closed and all schools moved to full day home-based learning. While the pandemic has evidently changed the daily routine of the residents, the emotional impact on them is less known. This study aimed to explore the emotional impacts of COVID-19 to the Singapore society during the pandemic. By analyzing social media (Twitter) data through sentiment analysis, this study revealed and discussed the residents' emotion patterns and their changes due to COVID-19 along the dimensions of anger, fear, anticipation, trust, surprise, sadness, joy, and disgust. The study found that people in Singapore generally had a high level of trust and positive attitude facing the crisis, but the emotional responses vary among people twitted with different languages. },

  abstract={The COVID-19 epidemic has unleashed a trail of health and economic destruction since the first infected patient was reported in Wuhan, China in late 2019. While this disease is seemingly not as deadly compared to SARS, Ebola, or MERS, it is an exceptionally virulent plague. Evidence has suggested that certain segments of the population and environmental attributes are more vulnerable. Specifically, the elderly people and those with pre-existing medical conditions reported the highest morbidity from COVID-19 infection. Places that are densely populated, with voluminous human traffic, and fleeting social interactions are ostensibly most conducive for viral transmission. Geospatial networks with high centrality and transitivity such as public transportations, leisure and recreational spaces, and workplaces, are locations most susceptible to COVID-19. In response to this epidemic, Singapore entered into a lockdown to curb the spread. All but essential workers such as those in healthcare, public services, and critical supply chains, were required to work from home and minimize interpersonal contact. This study aims to understand local vulnerability by introducing changes of risks and human mobilities across space and time. The study develops a socio-ecological framework of epidemiology using a set of social, built, and spatial features known to influence disease transmission. Subzones with higher integrated vulnerabilities could receive greater epidemiological attention and support in future pandemics. },

  abstract={People live in cities. However, different groups of people are active at varying times at distinct places in their daily lives, forming different activity spaces and times within a city. Previous studies focused on the distribution of the activity or the partition of regions based on similarity or strength of the interaction, but not the collective activity spaces and times of the people who live within the area. Using only the geotagged/timestamped social media as a proxy, this study intended to delineate activity spaces and times of eight selected cities, including Tokyo, Osaka, Hongkong, Singapore, Bangkok, Jakarta, Manila, and Penang. Activity space is defined as a geographic extent where people undertake their daily life. This study generated two co-occurrence networks (spatial and temporal) for each city and delineated the activity spaces and times using a network community detection method. In summary, the results showed a clear pattern for both activity spaces and times in the eight cities. The activity spaces results showed spatially continuous communities with clear borders, indicated the boundaries of human movements, which may be affected by political or natural separation. The activity time results existed a cyclic pattern on a daily and weekly basis, indicating the habits of people in each city, and which pattern is slightly different between cities. In conclusion, this study demonstrated a framework for delineating activity spaces and provided a novel perspective for representing the space and time patterns of daily life in a city. },

  abstract={Huang et al. used their EpiRank algorithm, which emphasizes forward-and-backward commuter flow between homes and workplaces, to analyze the distribution patterns of two infectious diseases in Taiwan： the 2009-H1N1 influenza virus and the widespread emergence of the 2000-2008 type 71 enterovirus (EV). As this article was being prepared, the spreading mechanism of the novel coronavirus disease now designated as COVID-19 had yet to be identified, but according to the American Centers for Disease Control, its spreading mechanism and patterns are likely more similar to influenza than to other coronaviruses such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV-1) or Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV). To consider potential COVID-19 spatial patterns, we applied EpiRank to the 2003 SARS outbreak in north Taiwan for comparison with H1N1 and EV. SARS was found to be less contagious than H1N1 or EV, but with a significantly higher fatality rate. The characteristics of these diseases determined their specific spatial spreading patterns, as reflected in the different effects of forward and backward commuting movement. Our motivation is to highlight these differences and to illustrate EpiRank spatial patterns for the 2003 SARS outbreak for comparison with EpiRank-determined distributions for the H1N1 and EV outbreaks. Our results indicate that the daytime parameter (i.e., forward movement effect) range was slightly higher (0.5-0.55) for the SARS outbreak than for either the influenza (0.4-0.5) or EV (0.3-0.5) outbreaks, suggesting that the forward-and-backward movements of individuals between residential and core urban areas with concentrated populations were equally important regarding the spread of SARS. While COVID-19 might resemble either SARS or H1N1 in terms of spatial spreading, its daytime parameter is likely somewhere in-between, with backward movement being dominant (similar to H1N1) or with forward and backward movement being equally important (similar to SARS). Building on Huang et al.’s paper, we present an estimated risk distribution pattern for the Taipei Metropolitan Area for a daytime parameter of 0.55. },

  abstract={Barometers are among the oldest engineered sensors. Historically, they have been primarily used either as environmental sensors to measure the atmospheric pressure for weather forecasts or as altimeters for aircrafts. With the advent of microelectromechanical system (MEMS)-based barometers and their systematic embedding in smartphones and wearable devices, a vast breadth of new applications for the use of barometers has emerged. For instance, it is now possible to use barometers in conjunction with other sensors to track and identify a wide range of human activity classes. However, the effectiveness of barometers in the growing field of human activity recognition critically hinges on our understanding of the numerous factors affecting the atmospheric pressure, as well as on the properties of the sensor itself—sensitivity, accuracy, variability, etc. This review article thoroughly details all these factors and presents a comprehensive report of the numerous studies dealing with one or more of these factors in the particular framework of human activity tracking and recognition. In addition, we specifically collected some experimental data to illustrate the effects of these factors, which we observed to be in good agreement with the findings in the literature. We conclude this review with some suggestions on some possible future uses of barometric sensors for the specific purpose of tracking human activities. },

  abstract={As lockdowns and stay-at-home orders start to be lifted across the globe, governments are struggling to establish effective and practical guidelines to reopen their economies. In dense urban environments with people returning to work and public transportation resuming full capacity, enforcing strict social distancing measures will be extremely challenging, if not practically impossible. Governments are thus paying close attention to particular locations that may become the next cluster of disease spreading. Indeed, certain places, like some people, can be “super-spreaders”. Is a bustling train station in a central business district more or less susceptible and vulnerable as compared to teeming bus interchanges in the suburbs? Here, we propose a quantitative and systematic framework to identify spatial super-spreaders and the novel concept of super-susceptibles, i.e. respectively, places most likely to contribute to disease spread or to people contracting it. Our proposed data-analytic framework is based on the daily-aggregated ridership data of public transport in Singapore. By constructing the directed and weighted human movement networks and integrating human flow intensity with two neighborhood diversity metrics, we are able to pinpoint super-spreader and super-susceptible locations. Our results reveal that most super-spreaders are also super-susceptibles and that counterintuitively, busy peripheral bus interchanges are riskier places than crowded central train stations. Our analysis is based on data from Singapore, but can be readily adapted and extended for any other major urban center. It therefore serves as a useful framework for devising targeted and cost-effective preventive measures for urban planning and epidemiological preparedness. },

  abstract={Many real-world networks consisting of nodes representing (in)tangible asymmetric information or energy flows must be modeled as directed graphs (digraphs). Several methods for classifying non-directional edges in terms of strong or weak ties have been developed for well-known non-directional networks, but none specifically for directed networks. In almost all cases, definitions and identification methods are simple, incomplete, reliant on intuition, and based on the assumption that anything that is not weak must be strong. Researchers have generally failed to consider overlapping and hierarchical community properties that accurately reflect organizational structures or the functional components commonly found in real-world complex networks, resulting in multiple challenges to analyzing many types of directed networks. In this paper we describe a method that considers asymmetric definitions of arc strength, especially when arcs hold important directional significance. To more fully capture overlapping and hierarchical network community structures, we used hierarchy-based definitions to identify bond arcs, k th-layer local bridges, global bridges, and silk arcs and to create a hierarchical arc type analysis (HATA) algorithm. The algorithm employs a mix of common middle node measures and statistical parameters generated by randomized directed networks corresponding to the network being investigated. To test the HATA algorithm, we conducted four experiments involving a mix of arc rewiring and additions, multiple datasets associated with the Travian game, 56 empirical networks from previous studies, and 3 bird song transition networks. Our results indicate that HATA offers a novel perspective to understanding arc strengths and structures in directed complex networks. },

Here we describe our proposal for a hierarchical edge type analysis (HETA) algorithm for determining link types at multiple network hierarchy levels based on the common neighbor concept plus statistical factors such as bond links, kth-layer local bridges, global bridges, and silk links—all generated during long-term network development and evolution processes. Two sets of networks were used to validate our proposed algorithm, one consisting of 16 networks employed in multiple past studies, and one consisting of two types of one-dimensional small-world networks expressing different random rewiring or shortcut addition probabilities. Two applications with potential for developmental contributions are demonstrated： a network fingerprint analysis framework, and a hierarchical network community partition method. },

The authors use a Markov chain model and PageRank-like algorithm to construct a novel algorithm called EpiRank to measure infection risk in a spatially confined commuting network on Taiwan island. Data from the country’s 2000 census were used to map epidemic risk distribution as a commuting network function. A daytime parameter was used to integrate forward and backward movement in order to analyze daily commuting patterns. EpiRank algorithm results were tested by comparing calculations with actual disease distributions for the 2009 H1N1 influenza outbreak and enterovirus cases between 2000 and 2008. Results suggest that the bidirectional movement model outperformed models that considered forward or backward direction only in terms of capturing spatial epidemic risk distribution. EpiRank also outperformed models based on network indexes such as PageRank and HITS. According to a sensitivity analysis of the daytime parameter, the backward movement effect is more important than the forward movement effect for understanding a commuting network’s disease diffusion structure. Our evidence supports the use of EpiRank as an alternative network measure for analyzing disease diffusion in a commuting network. },

  abstract={Conventional spatial statistics analysis reveal either the global or local spatial pattern for point distribution but ignore the big picture of the point data, which can be observed through a scaling process. As discussed in spatial statistical studies, point distribution may show a scale-dependent spatial pattern, which situation is known as the modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP). On the other hand, as suggested in fractal analysis studies, the point pattern change at a consistent rate at the beginning of the scaling process, and the rate decrease after a scale. This scale of rate shifting (namely critical scale, CS) is the finest scale that can capture the big picture of the point distribution (namely macro pattern), i.e. the changes of pattern due to MAUP have the same effect since the global level, and the higher scales after CS will only affect the pattern of partial area. In this study, a scaling analysis framework was proposed to identify the critical scale, and a set of aggregation procedure was designed to convert the original point dataset into the macro pattern. Three experiments were conducted to test the scaling analysis framework, including two experiments on theoretical distributions and one on empirical point distributions. The three experiments were designed: (1) to test the aggregation effect on scaling process; (2) to test the influences of mono-centric clustering properties to the scaling analysis; and (3) to illustrates the contrast between macro patterns and the original distribution of empirical data. The results suggested that the aggregation point on critical scale could capture most of the spatial properties from original data; the area and number of point formed algorithm relationship with the critical and final scale; and the big picture of the point distribution could be captured by the macro pattern of the aggregated points on critical scale. Aside from the conventional understanding of point pattern as discussed in the previous global or local spatial statistics methods, this study provides not only a new tool but also a novel perspective of viewing the point distribution. This analysis framework, including the critical scale identification and macro pattern aggregation, can be useful for spatial point data exploration and map visualization.},

Our results show that, by analyzing the topological characteristics of streets and volume data for a small fraction of street segments in Taipei City, the most congested segments of the city were identified successfully. The identified congested segments are significantly close to the potential congestion zones, including the officially announced most congested streets, the segments with slow moving speeds at rush hours, and the areas near significant landmarks. The identified congested segments also captured congestion-prone areas concentrated in the business districts and industrial areas of the city. Identifying the topological characteristics and flow complexity of traffic congestion provides network topological insights for sustainable urban planning, and these characteristics can be used to further understand congestion propagation. },

We argue that the temporal lag between events is a key to understand the process of diffusion movement. Using the temporal lag could help to clarify the types of close relationships. This study aims to develop a data exploration algorithm, namely the TrAcking Progression In Time And Space (TaPiTaS) algorithm, for understanding diffusion processes. Based on the spatial distance and temporal interval between cases, TaPiTaS detects sub-clusters, a group of events that have high probability of having common sources, identifies progression links, the relationships between sub-clusters, and tracks progression chains, the connected components of sub-clusters. Dengue Fever cases data was used as an illustrative case study. The location and temporal range of sub-clusters are presented, along with the progression links. TaPiTaS algorithm contributes a more detailed and in-depth understanding of the development of progression chains, namely the geographic diffusion process. },

International travelers who acquire dengue infection are important routes for virus transmission from one country to another. Previous studies have shown that imported dengue cases are able to initiate indigenous epidemics when appropriate weather conditions are present. However, the spatial-temporal associations between imported dengue cases and indigenous epidemics in areas with different social-demographic conditions remain unclear. This study investigated the determinants of spatial-temporal lags of imported dengue cases that initiated indigenous epidemics from 2003 to 2012 in Taiwan. We constructed Origin-Destination (OD) pairs of transmission from imported townships to local emergence to capture two important epidemiological characteristics： 1) the risk of diffusion and 2) the speed of transmission. We further explored the spatial-temporal associations between disease importation and social-demographic indicators with geographic heterogeneity. Our results indicated that there were significant relationships between the time lags from imported cases to local emergence in late spring and early summer. Moreover, urbanization levels influence the speed of transmission. Our findings also showed that the risk of diffusion weighted by distance-decay characteristics increases the explanatory power of socioeconomic variables in imported townships. These findings imply that disease importation in late spring and early summer may be an early warning indicator of indigenous dengue epidemics and that the risk of transmission may be significantly influenced by the effects of inter-township travel. },

Therefore, the aims of this study were to establish actual patient flow for seeking healthcare and to clarify the factors influencing preferences for seeking healthcare. Methods: We estimated the residence and collected the locations of healthcare visits for each patient from the nationwide Longitudinal Health Insurance Database in 2010 to establish an origin-destination matrix. The patient flow among townships could be conducted from the matrix. The weighted travel distance of healthcare visits was developed as a new indicator of accessibility. The gravity model was then used to analyze the patient flow and assess the influences of travel distance and healthcare resources. Results: Using the weighted travel distance, eastern Taiwan and the coastal areas of Yunlin and Chiayi were identified as the poorest accessibility for healthcare resources. The results of the gravity model showed that travel distance was the major factor correlated negatively with the volumes of outpatient and inpatient/emergency flow; however, the abundance of healthcare resources positively influenced the preference of inpatient/emergency patients from their residence to neighborhood regions for seeking healthcare. Conclusions: The weighted travel distance could properly reflect the access of healthcare. We conclude that travel distance is the major factor which influences patient flow for seeking healthcare. In contrast, people tend to choose the healthcare facilities with abundant resources for seeking inpatient/emergency healthcare. 目標：過去研究多以行政區或醫療分區的每萬人口醫療資源數作為評估就醫可近性之指標,但分區的概念簡化民眾就醫行為,與實際醫療利用情形有所落差。本研究將以實際就醫流動資料呈現各地區醫療可近性,並量化就醫距離與醫療資源分布對就醫流動的影響。方法：使用全民健康保險研究資料庫2010年承保抽樣歸人檔,依居住地與就醫地建立流動起迄矩陣,計算各鄉鎮市區加權就醫距離作為可近性指標,再以引力模式估計影響就醫流動的因素。結果：加權就醫距離呈現出花東與雲嘉沿海等地有較差的醫療可近性。引力模式分析顯示,就醫距離與醫療資源皆顯著影響民眾的就醫流動。然而,相較於急診與住院的就醫流動,就醫距離對於門診就醫流動影響更為明顯。但於鄰近地區的就醫權衡,醫療機構一般病床數對於急診與住院就醫流動的吸引力,更重於就醫距離的效果。結論：加權就醫距離更能客觀反映一地醫療可近性。求近是台灣民眾就醫的首要考量,但民眾急診與住院就醫,則傾向在鄰近地區中尋求硬體規模最大者。 },

Topological networks of spatial features are used to explore geographical connectivity and structures. The PageRank algorithm, a network metric, is often used to help identify important locations where people or automobiles concentrate in the geographical literature. However, geographic considerations, including proximity and location attractiveness, are ignored in most network metrics. The objective of the present study is to propose two geographically modified PageRank algorithms—Distance-Decay PageRank (DDPR) and Geographical PageRank (GPR)—that incorporate geographic considerations into PageRank algorithms to identify the spatial concentration of human movement in a geospatial network. Our findings indicate that in both intercity and within-city settings the proposed algorithms more effectively capture the spatial locations where people reside than traditional commonly-used network metrics. In comparing location attractiveness and distance decay, we conclude that the concentration of human movement is largely determined by the distance decay. This implies that geographic proximity remains a key factor in human mobility. },

  abstract={Respiratory diseases mainly spread through interpersonal contact. Class suspension is the most direct strategy to prevent the spread of disease through elementary or secondary schools by blocking the contact network. However, as university students usually attend courses in different buildings, the daily contact patterns on a university campus are complicated, and once disease clusters have occurred, suspending classes is far from an efficient strategy to control disease spread. The purpose of this study is to propose a methodological framework for generating campus location networks from a routine administration database, analyzing the community structure of the network, and identifying the critical links and nodes for blocking respiratory disease transmission. The data comes from the student enrollment records of a major comprehensive university in Taiwan. We combined the social network analysis and spatial interaction model to establish a geo-referenced community structure among the classroom buildings. We also identified the critical links among the communities that were acting as contact bridges and explored the changes in the location network after the sequential removal of the high-risk buildings. Instead of conducting a questionnaire survey, the study established a standard procedure for constructing a location network on a large-scale campus from a routine curriculum database. We also present how a location network structure at a campus could function to target the high-risk buildings as the bridges connecting communities for blocking disease transmission. },

  abstract={Spatial diffusion processes can be seen in many geographic phenomena that spread or migrate across space and over time. Studies of these processes were mostly done with verbal description until Hägerstrand (1966) started to approach it with quantitative models. A variety of attempts were made to continue this effort, but only with various degrees of success. Recognizing the critical role that distances between geographic objects or events play in a spatial diffusion process, we experimented with a new approach that uses these distances to detect and distinguish different types of spatial diffusion processes. Our approach is a two-step process that first calculates nearest neighbor ratios in a point process at each time step and then applies regression curve estimation to observe how these ratios change over time. We first report the results from applying this method to three spatio-temporal data sets which show the feasibility of our approach. We then report results of randomly simulated spatial diffusion processes to see if our approach is effective for the purpose of distinguishing different types of spatial diffusion processes. With only extreme cases as exceptions, our experiment found that using estimated regression curves of nearest neighbor ratios over time is usable in classifying spatial diffusion processes to either contagious/expansion or hierarchical/relocation diffusion processes.},

  abstract={A geospatial network represents the spatial relationships with the network perspective.  Within the scope of social network analysis, the network topology characteristics, including network centrality, small world and scale-free properties, have been well studied, and these concepts can also provide important implications on measuring the important of places in the geospatial network. PageRank (PR), which is an important link analysis algorithm, is what Google uses to determine how important a page is on the web. However, most measures of network analysis were designed to understand network topological structures rather than geographical structures. Therefore, these measures have not considered the geographical relationships as their main concern, including geographical distance decay effect between nodes. This study incorporates geographic properties, including distance-decay and spatial interactions among nodes, and proposes two modified PR algorithms, Inverse-Distance PageRank (IDPR) and Geographical PageRank (GPR). To test the performance of the index of importance (including IDPR and GPR), this study did two experiments with the inter-city network of Taiwan. In the first experiment, this study calculated the index of importance, and this study used the population data and inter-townships car flow data as observed data to check the Spearman Rank Correlation, and compared the correlation results with existing algorithms: PR and Weighted PageRank (WPR); in the second experiment, this study explore the changes of node’s importance between before and after the construction of Taiwan High Speed Rail System. Our findings in the first experiment showed that IDPR and GPR are better correlated to the observed data, and our findings in the second experiment showed that the GPR and WPR could capture the transitive effect. Since IDPR and GPR take the distance decay effect into account, results using the algorithms can capture more geographical properties. In conclusion, IDPR and GPR are better metrics to be used in geospatial network analysis; but, if the transitive effect is an important feature in the analysis, GPR is a better metric.},
