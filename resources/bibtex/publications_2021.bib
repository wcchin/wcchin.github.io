  abstract={During the global pandemic of COVID-19, all affected countries have taken a series of contingent measures to thwart the spreading of the virus. Singapore is one of the countries affected by the first wave of the COVID-19 outbreak in January 2020. It entered the “Circuit Breaker” (CB) period on 7 April 2020 when most workplaces were closed and all schools moved to full day home-based learning. While the pandemic has evidently changed the daily routine of the residents, the emotional impact on them is less known. This study aimed to explore the emotional impacts of COVID-19 to the Singapore society during the pandemic. By analyzing social media (Twitter) data through sentiment analysis, this study revealed and discussed the residents' emotion patterns and their changes due to COVID-19 along the dimensions of anger, fear, anticipation, trust, surprise, sadness, joy, and disgust. The study found that people in Singapore generally had a high level of trust and positive attitude facing the crisis, but the emotional responses vary among people twitted with different languages. },

  abstract={The COVID-19 epidemic has unleashed a trail of health and economic destruction since the first infected patient was reported in Wuhan, China in late 2019. While this disease is seemingly not as deadly compared to SARS, Ebola, or MERS, it is an exceptionally virulent plague. Evidence has suggested that certain segments of the population and environmental attributes are more vulnerable. Specifically, the elderly people and those with pre-existing medical conditions reported the highest morbidity from COVID-19 infection. Places that are densely populated, with voluminous human traffic, and fleeting social interactions are ostensibly most conducive for viral transmission. Geospatial networks with high centrality and transitivity such as public transportations, leisure and recreational spaces, and workplaces, are locations most susceptible to COVID-19. In response to this epidemic, Singapore entered into a lockdown to curb the spread. All but essential workers such as those in healthcare, public services, and critical supply chains, were required to work from home and minimize interpersonal contact. This study aims to understand local vulnerability by introducing changes of risks and human mobilities across space and time. The study develops a socio-ecological framework of epidemiology using a set of social, built, and spatial features known to influence disease transmission. Subzones with higher integrated vulnerabilities could receive greater epidemiological attention and support in future pandemics. },

  abstract={People live in cities. However, different groups of people are active at varying times at distinct places in their daily lives, forming different activity spaces and times within a city. Previous studies focused on the distribution of the activity or the partition of regions based on similarity or strength of the interaction, but not the collective activity spaces and times of the people who live within the area. Using only the geotagged/timestamped social media as a proxy, this study intended to delineate activity spaces and times of eight selected cities, including Tokyo, Osaka, Hongkong, Singapore, Bangkok, Jakarta, Manila, and Penang. Activity space is defined as a geographic extent where people undertake their daily life. This study generated two co-occurrence networks (spatial and temporal) for each city and delineated the activity spaces and times using a network community detection method. In summary, the results showed a clear pattern for both activity spaces and times in the eight cities. The activity spaces results showed spatially continuous communities with clear borders, indicated the boundaries of human movements, which may be affected by political or natural separation. The activity time results existed a cyclic pattern on a daily and weekly basis, indicating the habits of people in each city, and which pattern is slightly different between cities. In conclusion, this study demonstrated a framework for delineating activity spaces and provided a novel perspective for representing the space and time patterns of daily life in a city. },
